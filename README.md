# How to use multiple GitHub accounts on the same computer using SSH


### Why would anyone want to this?
For example if you use the same computer for your personal projects and therefore, account, as well as, for work projects, where you have to use an account associated with an organization, having the ability to easily toggle between accounts can be a great time-saver. At the very least, that was my motivation.
